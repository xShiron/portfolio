  This repository contains some of the project that I've developed along my univerity studies

## Repository Contents
- **Amazon_Co-Purchases**
  This project was developed for the course titled "Analysis of Complex Data" and it consists in analyzing a graph dataset that represents Frequent Co-Purchases of Amazon Products. Common techniques used in Network Science were employed as a means to extract information about the graphs' nodes and edges. 

- **DeepFakeDetection**
  This project was developed for the course titled "Deep Learning". This project explores how different design decisions affect models' performance when detecting deep faked videos using well known architectures in Deep Learning literature. The results that were obtained are discussed along with the methodology used for this project.

- **Node_Backend_API**
  This project was half of my bachelors' final project. For this project I had to develop a Backend API using Node.JS which would then be contacted by a React.JS Frontend to display the information obtained fomr the Backend. The application was deployed in AWS instances.
